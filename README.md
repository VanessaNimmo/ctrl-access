# README for Ctrl-Access

## Created for GovHack 2018

Ctrl-Access aims to allow individuals to access open data sets to help make decisions in their personal lives. We envision an open marketplace where developers can create lifestyle modules that link specific data sets with different lifestyle ideas, for example, how does an individual's activity data stack up against the activity data for long-lived individuals?

This repo represents a small part of one such module. Linking building accessibility data, pedestrian volume data and tree data from the Melbourne CBD, this module will provide information on how to move through the city according to your accessibility needs. This code does calculations for pedestrian sensor data.
